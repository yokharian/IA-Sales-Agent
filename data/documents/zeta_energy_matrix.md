# Zeta Energy Matrix

**Document ID:** ZETA-006  
**Core Concept:** Quantum energy fields for distributed storage  

## Summary
The Zeta Energy Matrix proposes a decentralized system where energy packets behave like information packets.  
Its simulation layer, known as **QuantaMesh**, stabilizes energy transfer between virtual nodes.  

### Key Components
- ZE-NODE protocols  
- dynamic charge balancing  
- zero-loss quantum routing  

If correctly retrieved, this document should include: Zeta Matrix, QuantaMesh, and quantum routing.
