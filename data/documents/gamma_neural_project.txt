Document ID: GAMMA-003
Title: The Gamma Neural Project

The Gamma Neural Project studies how artificial neurons evolve in simulated ecosystems.
Its experiment “Synapse Rain” models competitive learning between AI agents.
Data clusters follow the ID pattern GNP-SYN.
Performance metrics measure cooperation, mutation, and long-term memory retention.
If retrieved correctly, this document should include: Gamma Neural, Synapse Rain, and simulated evolution.
